### More e-paper that are supportet:

- waveshare 7.5 V2 (e.g. from
  [berrybase](https://www.berrybase.de/sensoren-module/displays/epaper-displays/7.5-800-215-480-epaper-display-hat-f-252-r-raspberry-pi-v2))
- waveshare 3.7 (e.g. from
  [welectron](https://www.welectron.com/Waveshare-18057-37inch-e-Paper-HAT))

The config.ini needs the following settings when using the 7.5 inch:

```
epd_type = 7in5_V2
orientation = 270
layout_list=ohlc
```

## Usage

### Ticker view

The Tickers the following information:

- Block height, Mean block intervall in minutes, Time
- Minimal Block fee for the first 7 blocks in mempool
- Dollar price of a bitcoin
- Satoshi per Dollar (also know as moskow time)
- Sotoshi per Euro
- Euro price of a bitcoin

Whenever a new block has arrived on the blockchain, the following information is shown
for 120 seconds (can be disabled in the config.ini):

- Euro price of a bitcoin, mean block intervall in minutes, Time
- Minimal Block fee for the first 7 blocks in mempool
- Blocks in mempook, Number of transaction in mempool
- Blocks until next difficulty retargeting, est. difficulty multiplier, est. retarget
  time
- Block height

Due to the limited lifetime of 1000000 refreshes and an expected lifetime of 5 years,
the refresh period has been set to 216 seconds.

### Buttons

There are four buttons which the following behaviour (Please be patient after pressing,
the e-ink is quite slow):

1. Switch through different ticker views (views can be selected in the config.ini)
2. Switch BTC/fiat graph through 1, 3 and 7 days (Can be changed in the config.ini)
3. Switch the layout of the ticker (layouts can be selected in the config.ini)
4. Switch inverted mode

### Switching to ro-mode

Per default, the file system is mounted writable. When there is a empty ro file in
/boot, the filesystem will remounted readonly.

```
sudo touch /boot/ro
```

enables the readonly remount. The file can also be created with a PC, similar to the ssh
file.

### Switching between ro and rw mode

After logging in with ssh,

```
rw
```

remounts the file system with write support.

```
ro
```

switches back to readonly.

### Config.ini

It possible to personalize the ticker to your needs. After logging into your raspi with
SSH, the config can be edited with

```
rw
nano config.ini
ro
```

After writing the change to the ini file, a restart of the btc-ticker service is needed:

```
sudo systemctl restart btcticker
```

### Update btc-ticker without reflashing the sdcard

After logging into the btc-ticker with SSH, the update can be started with

```
rw
./99updateMenu.sh
```

Select now:

- PATCH
- Patch menu
- PATCH to update the ticker to the newest updates from git.

## Download image

- Downlad version 0.6.0 from
  [btc-ticker-0_6_0.img.gz](https://btc-ticker.com/btc-ticker-0_6_0.img.gz)
- Verify SHA256 checksum. It should be:
  `ebeb7e615237853f7388f3f8b00268c2e88b560104f711f11e76ed6e0e59805d`

### Flash SDcard with Raspberry Pi Imager

Use https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ for flashing the image to the sd-card.

- Select btc-ticker img file
- select sdcard
- Before writing click on settings and modify the following settings
- enable ssh with Use password authentication
- set username and password and write Username: admin Password: btcticker
- enable WiFi and enter your WiFi connection details
- start with clicking on write

### wpa_supplicant.conf (only when not using settings on Imager)

When you use the Raspberry Pi Imager with settings, there is no need for adding
wpa_supplicant.conf manually. When you did not enter your wifi credentials in the
settings menu, you need to do thefollowing:

- add `wpa_supplicant.conf` to the boot partition when mounted on PC

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=[COUNTRY_CODE]
network={
  ssid="[WIFI_SSID]"
  psk="[WIFI_PASSWORD]"
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

- replace `[COUNTRY_CODE]` with the ISO2 code (e.g. DE)
- Set `[WIFI_SSID]` and `[WIFI_PASSWORD]`
- On the first boot, the filesystem is mounted writable (Necessary for coping the
  wpa_supplicant.conf).
- When there is no wpa_supplicant.conf at /boot, the filesystem will be mounten
  readonly.

## Build SDcard from scratch

The SDcard build process is inspired by the great
[raspiblitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz).

- Download lastest
  [raspios image](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_oldstable_armhf/images/)
- Write the Image to a SD card
  [Tutorial](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)
- Add a `ssh` file to the boot partition when mounted on PC
- Add a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file, as shown in the section before. More information are
  also available
  [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md)
- Login via SSH to `ssh pi@[IP-OF-YOUR-RASPI]` using password `raspberry`

The image can now be build with:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btc-ticker/btc-ticker/main/build_sdcard.sh && sudo bash build_sdcard.sh
```

After everything run through, it is possible to login with the password `btcticker` In
order to prepare everyting for release, run `/home/admin/XXprepareRelease.sh`. When you
just want to use it for yourself, you do not need to run
`/home/admin/XXprepareRelease.sh`.

## Changing the ssh password

In order to secure your btc-ticker in your local network, you should change the SSH
password after setting up everything.

- Login via SSH to `ssh admin@[IP-OF-YOUR-RASPI]` using the password `btcticker`
- Change the password (this will be improved in the next release)

```
echo "pi:NEWPASSWORD" | sudo chpasswd
echo "root:NEWPASSWORD" | sudo chpasswd
echo "admin:NEWPASSWORD" | sudo chpasswd
```

Replace `NEWPASSWORD` with the new password.

## Used APIs

btc-ticker is using the following APIs:

- [mempool.space/api](https://mempool.space/api), which can also be run locally in e.g.
  raspiblitz
- [coingecko api](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)
- [blockchain API v1](https://github.com/blockchain/api-v1-client-python) (only as
  backup, when mempool.space is not available)
